		<h2>Python Syntax</h2>
    <p>Python syntax is similar to other programming languages, and it is easy to learn and has a wide range of features. Some of the most common syntax include:</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>Indentation</li>
<p>indentation is used to indicate the start of a block of code, and it is important to use indentation to indicate the start and end of blocks of code.</p>

			
      <li>Comments</li>
</p> Comments are used to add information to your code that is not executed by the computer. They can be used to explain the code or to make it more readable.</p>
			<li>Semicolons</li>
			<p>Semicolons are used to end a statement in Python. They are optional in Python, but they are recommended for readability and consistency.</p>
			<li>Strings</li>
			<p>Strings are used to represent text in Python. They are enclosed in single or double quotes, and they can contain any characters, including numbers, symbols, and spaces.</p>
			<li>Integers</li>
			<p>Integers are used to represent whole numbers in Python. They are written without a decimal point and can be positive or negative.</p>
			<li>Floats</li>
			<p>Floats are used to represent decimal numbers in Python. They are written with a decimal point and can be positive or negative.</p>
			<li>Booleans</li>
			<p>Booleans are used to represent true or false values in Python. They are written as "True" or "False".</p>
			<li>Lists</li>
<li>Parentheses</li>
      <li>Brackets</li>#
      <li>and many more...</li>
		</ul>
<h3>Variables</h3>
		<p>Variables are <strong>names</strong> that <strong>store</strong> values <br>
		variables are also case sensitive.</p>
		<h3>Data Types</h3>
		<p>Data types are <strong>categories</strong> that <strong>define</strong> the <strong>type</strong> of data that a variable can store.</p>
		<p>Data types are <strong>case-sensitive</strong>.</p>
		<p>Data types are <strong>dynamic</strong> </p>

		<h3>Control Flow</h3>
		<p>Control flow is the <strong>order</strong> in which statements are executed meaning that statements can be executed in <strong>any order</strong>.
		<br>Control flow is also <strong>conditional</strong> meaning that statements are executed based on a condition. Control flow is <strong>iterative</strong>meaning that it repeats 
			a set of statements until a condition is met.		</p>
