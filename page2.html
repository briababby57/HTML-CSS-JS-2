		<h3>Variables </h3>
		<p>Variables are used to store data in a program. They can be used to store different types of data, such as numbers, strings, and boolean values.</p>
		<h3>Data Types</h3>
		<p>Data types are the different types of data that can be stored in a variable. There are several types of data types in Python, including integers, floats, strings, and boolean values.</p>
		<h3>Operators</h3>
		<p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. There are several types of operators in Python, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators.</p>		<h3>Control Flow</h3>
		<p>Control flow is the <strong>order</strong> in which statements are executed meaning that statements can be executed in <strong>any order</strong>.
		<br>Control flow is also <strong>conditional</strong> meaning that statements are executed based on a condition. Control flow is <strong>iterative</strong>meaning that it repeats a set of statements until a condition is met.		</p>
		<h3>Strings</h3>
